Description:
  Create a single page application showcasing your new online store utilizing React/Redux or vanilla JS.

Requirements:
  1. Create the application based on the design. Accuracy counts.

  2. Display each item found in the "store_items.json" file. Each item should show the name, image, price, quantity (total number of each item remaining).

  3. Display a cart on the same page which lists the added items.
    - the shopping cart should include:
        1. names of items.
        2. price of item.
        3. total cost of all items in the cart.
        3. a way to remove the item from the cart.
        
	(below 4-5 are optional, but if attempted please ensure quality)
        4. toggle to increase / decrease quantity.
          - when increasing the quantity be sure to not go over the available quantity of each item!
        5. confirm purchase button that clears out the cart.
          - when confirming the purchase, update the quantity values in the list of items.

* Helpful Hints:
	- UI and UX count! Imagine this was a design you need to translate into code.
	- Expected cart functionality should not be buggy or incomplete. 
	- People view things on different devices.
	- How you handle implied ux will also be evaluated.

Let us see your awesome store!:
  Once complete, please send a github link or a zip of your project files when completed.
